How to install P5Nitro - Linux
==============================

If you use your setup for work and feel more comfortable running things in a guest session, you can.

To do this in a guest login:

![Choose Guest Session](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20linux%20installation/Screen%20shot%202011-08-14%20at%2013.34.44.png)

OK now open a terminal:

![Open a terminal](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20linux%20installation/Screen%20shot%202011-08-14%20at%2013.35.35.png)

Ans type (or copy/paste) the following:

	wget -O - https://raw.github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/master/ToolsAndSources/Installer/P5NitroInstallerLinux.sh | sh

like so:

this script downloads a bunch of pieces needed by P5Nitro. Let it finish (it says "Installation complete"), and then open the home folder:

The home folder contains a new folder where P5Nitro is installed. Open it, and then open the application.linux folder inside it

Now, finally, launch the P5Nitro script by double-clicking it:
