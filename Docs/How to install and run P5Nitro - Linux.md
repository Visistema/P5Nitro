How to install and run P5Nitro - Linux
==============================

If you use your setup for work and feel more comfortable running things in a sandboxed guest session, just open a Guest Session:

![Choose Guest Session](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20linux%20installation/Screen%20shot%202011-08-14%20at%2013.34.44.png)

OK now open a terminal:

You can go to any directory where you have write access. The home directory is used here, which is normally where the terminal opens.

And type (or copy/paste) the command below. Note that "O" in "-O" is a capital "o" letter, not a zero.

	wget -O - https://raw.github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/master/ToolsAndSources/Installer/P5NitroInstallerLinux.sh | sh

like so:

this script takes a minute or so. Let it finish (it says "Installation complete"), and then open the home folder (if you picked another location for the install, browse to that location instead):

A new folder called P5Nitro is visible. Open it, and then open the application.linux folder inside it

![Contents of application.linux folder](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20linux%20installation/Screen%20shot%202011-08-14%20at%2013.43.42.png)

Now, finally, launch the P5Nitro script by double-clicking it - click "Run" when prompted:

![Click on P5Nitro app](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20linux%20installation/Screen%20shot%202011-08-14%20at%2013.44.16.png)
![Confirm to run](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20linux%20installation/Screen%20shot%202011-08-14%20at%2013.44.31.png)

The P5Nitro window will show-up - type some simple Processing code:

and then click the play button. The sketch will appear.
