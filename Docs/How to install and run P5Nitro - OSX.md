How to install and run P5Nitro - OSX
======================


If you use your setup for work and feel more comfortable running things in a sandboxed guest session, just open a Guest Session. To enable Guest Sessions on OSX, just follow [these steps](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/15600.html).

Hint: it's a checkbox in the "Accounts" panel in the System preferences:

![Choose Guest Session](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20osx%20installation/Capture.PNG)

...and then logout and click on "Guest" on the login window:

OK now open a terminal:

You can go to any directory where you have write access. The home directory is used here, which is normally where the terminal opens.

Now type (or copy/paste) the command below.

	curl https://raw.github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/master/ToolsAndSources/Installer/P5NitroInstallerSnowLeopard.sh | sh

like so:

![Open the home folder](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20osx%20installation/Capture5.PNG)

this script takes a minute or so. Let it finish (it says "Installation complete"), and then open the home folder (if you picked another location for the install, browse to that location instead). A new folder called P5Nitro is visible.

Now, finally, launch P5Nitro by double-clicking the P5Nitro icon.

The P5Nitro window will show-up - type some simple Processing code:

![Click on P5Nitro app](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20osx%20installation/Capture8.PNG)

and then click the play button. The sketch will appear.
