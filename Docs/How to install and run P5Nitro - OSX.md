How to install P5Nitro - OSX
======================


If you use your setup for work and feel more comfortable running things in a sandboxed guest session, just open a Guest Session:

OK now open a terminal:

You can go to any directory where you have write access. The home directory is used here, which is normally where the terminal opens.

And type (or copy/paste) the command below.

	curl https://raw.github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/master/ToolsAndSources/Installer/P5NitroInstallerSnowLeopard.sh | sh

like so:

![Install command](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20osx%20installation/Capture4.PNG)

this script takes a minute or so. Let it finish (it says "Installation complete"), and then open the home folder (if you picked another location for the install, browse to that location instead):

A new folder called P5Nitro is visible. Open it, and then open the P5Nitro.app folder inside it

![Contents of P5Nitro.app folder](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20osx%20installation/Capture7.PNG)

Now, finally, launch the P5Nitro script by double-clicking it. The P5Nitro window will show-up - type some simple Processing code:

![Click on P5Nitro app](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro/raw/master/Docs/Screenshots%20of%20osx%20installation/Capture8.PNG)

and then click the play button. The sketch will appear.
